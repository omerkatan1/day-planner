# day-planner


* This is an app that helps you better orginize your work day

* The app consists of boxes that are from 9am to 5pm, and each contain textboxes that whatever is typed in may be saved

* There is the live date and time on the top corner of the screen

* Also when the time passes the time on the textbox, then the past boxes will turn gray, present will turn yellow, and future boxes will always be green.

* The boxes are generated through a for loop in jquery and buttons are saved dynamically
